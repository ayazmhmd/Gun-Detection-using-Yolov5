# Gun-Detection-using-Yolov5
In this project i have used yolov5 to detect gun in an image. the dataset is taken from kaggle and the images resolution was irregular. I have used python library "Chitra" 
to resize all the images with their bounding box and applied the yolov5 model. The model achieved better MAP score
